# Build-test the Rust crates the way a downstream consumer sees them: package
# them with `cargo package`, unpack the archives *outside* this repository, and
# build a throwaway crate against the unpacked copies.
#
# Why this exists: `cargo publish --no-verify` (see "Publishing" in
# rust/README.md) means nothing in CI ever compiles what actually ships. The
# packaged crate is just the crate directory -- no C++ sources, no submodules,
# no monorepo around it -- so a mistake that only shows up there (a file missing
# from the package, a path dependency that does not resolve once rewritten to a
# registry dependency, a build script that assumes ../.. is the onnxsim source
# tree) is invisible to the in-tree `cargo build` the `build` job runs.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/test_rust_package_standalone.sh [options]
#
# Options:
#   --lib-dir DIR[:DIR...]  Link a pre-built onnxsim_c from these directories
#                           (ONNXSIM_LIB_DIR mode) and *run* the consumer, so
#                           the packaged crates are linked and executed, not
#                           just type-checked. "auto" searches this repo's
#                           rust/target for a library left by a previous
#                           `cargo build`.
#   --source-dir DIR        Build the native library from source with CMake
#                           against the onnxsim checkout at DIR
#                           (ONNXSIM_SOURCE_DIR mode) and run the consumer.
#                           Slow; honors ONNXSIM_PREBUILT_ORT=1.
#   --model PATH            Also simplify this ONNX model from the consumer
#                           binary (only used when the native library is
#                           linked).
#   --workdir DIR           Unpack into DIR instead of a fresh mktemp -d.
#                           Must be outside this repository.
#   --keep                  Do not delete the work directory on exit.
#
# With neither --lib-dir nor --source-dir the script runs in check-only mode:
# it type-checks the unpacked crates with ONNXSIM_NO_BUILD=1 (no native build,
# ~a minute) and asserts that a build with no mode selected fails fast with an
# actionable message instead of trying to compile the C++ stack from a
# directory that does not contain it.
