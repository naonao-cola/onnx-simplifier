"""Post-training weight pruning for MatMul/vanilla-Gemm (and, for structured
pruning, Conv) layers.

Surveying the pruning literature against what onnxsim can actually act on
(an exported ONNX graph, no training loop, no gradients, usually no labels)
narrows the field a lot. Most well-known pruning *tools* --
``torch.nn.utils.prune``, NNI's pruning API, Neural Magic's SparseML, Intel
Neural Compressor's pruning API -- assume a live framework model mid-training
or at least a fine-tuning loop to recover accuracy after each pruning step
(iterative magnitude pruning / the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, movement
pruning, "pattern lock" pruning, ...). That is the same reason onnxsim's
existing weight-only quantization stack (:mod:`onnxsim.gptq`,
:mod:`onnxsim.awq`, ...) reimplements each technique's *algorithm* against
raw ONNX MatMul/Gemm weights rather than depending on those libraries
directly: they operate one level up, on a model object onnxsim never has.

*Structured* pruning (removing whole channels/filters, e.g. Torch-Pruning,
NNI's L1/L2 filter pruning, network slimming, or the expert-intermediate-
channel/Mamba-state pruning inside NVIDIA's "Iterative Puzzle" compression
pipeline for hybrid MoE LLMs, https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.04371) is a
fundamentally bigger project than the rest of this module for two separate
reasons, and this module only takes on one of them. It *does* change tensor
shapes, which ripples through every downstream consumer of the pruned
dimension -- real graph surgery, not the self-contained per-layer weight
rewrite every other ``apply_*``/``quantize_*`` pass in onnxsim is. That part
:func:`apply_structured_pruning` takes on, but deliberately only for the
narrowest topology where the surgery is unambiguous: a single MatMul/Gemm
or ordinary (``group=1``) Conv whose output feeds, through a chain of
shape-preserving elementwise ops (activations, and for MatMul/Gemm also a
bias/scale add/mul) with no other consumer anywhere along that chain, into
exactly one downstream layer of the same family whose reduction/input-
channel dimension matches.
Any residual/skip connection, multi-consumer fan-out, or branch (all of
which need real dependency-graph analysis -- what Torch-Pruning's DepGraph
does in general) is left untouched rather than guessed at. The other part
of the paper's pipeline -- an architecture *search* over what to prune,
alternated with knowledge-distillation/RL recovery afterwards -- needs a
training loop onnxsim does not have and is not in scope here at all; this
is a single, static, no-retraining structural cut, closer in spirit to Li
et al.'s L2-norm filter pruning (below) than to anything iterative.

What *does* fit that mold, and needs no retraining loop: post-training
*unstructured* (or semi-structured N:M) pruning, à la magnitude pruning
(Han et al., 2015, "Learning both Weights and Connections for Efficient
Neural Networks", https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02626) and, for the
calibrated variant, Wanda (Sun et al., 2023, "A Simple and Effective
Pruning Approach for Large Language Models",
https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11695 -- the pruning analogue of this module's
neighbors :mod:`onnxsim.awq`/:mod:`onnxsim.smoothquant`: a single forward
pass over calibration data, no weight update, no backward pass at all).
Both zero out individual weight entries and leave every tensor's shape
exactly as it was, so -- like every ``quantize_weight_only_*`` pass here --
the result is a plain ONNX model, correct by construction (a MatMul/Gemm
with some zeroed entries computes the same op, just with less nonzero
data), that a runtime with sparse-kernel support (or a later, separate
dense-to-sparse repacking step) can exploit for speed.

:func:`apply_magnitude_pruning` uses ``|W|`` as the importance metric and
needs no calibration data at all -- the simple, data-free baseline.
:func:`apply_wanda_pruning` weights that by each input feature's activation
norm over calibration data (``|W_ij| * ||X_j||_2``), which -- per the
Wanda paper -- better protects weights that multiply high-magnitude
activations even when the weight itself is individually small, the same
class of outlier-activation effect that motivates :mod:`onnxsim.smoothquant`.

Both support two sparsity patterns, chosen per invocation:

- unstructured: for every output row (comparison group), the lowest-
  importance entries are zeroed until that row reaches the target
  ``sparsity`` fraction.
- semi-structured N:M (e.g. ``n=2, m=4`` -- NVIDIA Ampere's 2:4 structured
  sparsity, the pattern Wanda's own paper evaluates most): within every
  consecutive group of ``m`` input-channel entries in a row, only the
  ``n`` highest-importance survive.

:func:`weight_sparsity` reports the fraction of exact-zero entries across
every matched layer's weight, as a quick way to confirm a pruning call
reached its target (or to measure an already-sparse model).

:func:`apply_structured_pruning` actually removes channels (real shape
reduction, real FLOP/parameter reduction on any runtime, no sparse-kernel
support needed) from every producer -> consumer chain it can prove safe to
cut, per output-channel L2-norm importance (Li et al., 2017, "Pruning
Filters for Efficient ConvNets", https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08710) -- for a
MatMul/Gemm chain, that criterion is a transplant from Conv filters to
output channels (the same one :func:`apply_magnitude_pruning`/
:func:`apply_wanda_pruning` already made for Han et al./Wanda's element-wise
criteria); for a Conv chain it is the paper's own original setting, applied
directly: each output filter's full ``[in_channels, kH, kW]`` kernel is
flattened and ranked by its own L2 norm. Conv support is deliberately
narrower than the MatMul/Gemm path: only ordinary (``group=1``) 2-D
``Conv`` producers/consumers are matched, joined by unary activations alone
-- no per-channel ``Add``/``Mul`` scale-or-bias op, since a real Conv
already carries any bias in its own optional third input, and
``BatchNormalization`` is expected to already be fused into the preceding
Conv's weight by the time this pass runs (onnxsim's own default
optimization does exactly that, see ``fuse_bn_into_conv``), so a raw
per-channel affine between two Convs isn't a shape this pass special-cases.
A grouped or depthwise Conv (``group != 1``) is left untouched entirely:
its output and input channels aren't independent per-index the way this
pass's single producer/consumer cut assumes.
:func:`apply_structured_wanda_pruning` is the calibrated upgrade of that
same technique -- ``||W_row||_2 * ||X||_2`` per channel instead of weight
magnitude alone -- exactly the same relationship Wanda has to plain
magnitude pruning, transplanted from individual weights (or, for Conv,
whole filters) to whole channels. Because either changes shapes, the
result is unconditionally irreversible and, unlike a retrained pipeline,
has no distillation/RL step to recover whatever accuracy the cut costs --
evaluate the result before shipping it, the same caution any lossy onnxsim
pass deserves.

    """Removes whole output channels from MatMul/vanilla-Gemm layers --
    real structural pruning (smaller weight tensors, smaller matmuls on any
    runtime, not just one with sparse-kernel support), as opposed to
    :func:`apply_magnitude_pruning`/:func:`apply_wanda_pruning`'s value-only
    zeroing. See this module's own docstring for the technique, its L2-norm
    importance metric, and why it's restricted to an unambiguous single
    producer -> consumer topology rather than general dependency-graph
    pruning. :func:`apply_structured_wanda_pruning` is the calibrated
    upgrade of this same technique, exactly as :func:`apply_wanda_pruning`
    is to :func:`apply_magnitude_pruning`.

    For every MatMul/vanilla-Gemm node (the "producer") whose output feeds,
    through zero or more shape-preserving elementwise ops (an activation,
    or an Add/Mul against a constant per-channel bias/scale) with no other
    consumer anywhere along that path, into exactly one downstream
    MatMul/vanilla-Gemm's reduction dimension (the "consumer"): ranks the
    producer's output channels by L2 norm of their own weight row, drops
    the lowest-``sparsity``-fraction of them, and removes the corresponding
    rows/columns from the producer's weight (and bias, if it has a constant
    one) and every intermediate per-channel constant, and the matching
    columns/rows from the consumer's weight -- a shape change that leaves
    the two layers' composition mathematically unaffected for every
    surviving channel.

    The same cut applies to ordinary (``group=1``) 2-D ``Conv`` producer ->
    consumer pairs -- each output filter's whole ``[in_channels, kH, kW]``
    kernel ranked by its own L2 norm, exactly Li et al.'s original filter-
    pruning criterion -- joined only by unary activations (no per-channel
    Add/Mul: a Conv already carries its own bias, and ``BatchNormalization``
    is expected to already be fused into the preceding Conv by the time this
    pass runs). A grouped or depthwise Conv is left untouched.

    Also handles the gated FFN pattern most current LLMs use in place of a
    plain two-layer MLP (SwiGLU/GeGLU: ``down(act(gate(x)) * up(x))``, see
    :func:`_find_gated_chains`) -- two producers (gate and up) combined by
    an elementwise product feed one consumer; both branches are ranked by
    combined (root-sum-square) importance and pruned to the *same*
    surviving channel indices, since they're about to be multiplied. This
    gated form is MatMul/Gemm-only -- Conv chains don't take part in it.
